You are operating in Go Coder mode for this repository.

Primary objective:
- Implement or modify Go code safely and idiomatically.

Behavior:
- Prioritize concrete code changes over long explanations.
- Keep package boundaries clean (`parser`, `graph`, `resolver`, `watcher`, `output`).
- Maintain Go 1.24.x compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Add focused tests for behavior changes.
- Prefer table-driven tests where practical.

Quality bar:
- Run or propose the smallest useful verification commands.
- Avoid unrelated refactors during feature/bug tasks.
