## 2026-02-20

### Added
- `output:` Added **SARIF v2.1.0 report** generation (`internal/ui/report/formats/sarif.go`).
  - CLI flag: `--sarif <path>` (overrides `output.sarif` config field).
  - Three rule classes: `CIRC001` (circular dependency), `CIRC002` (potential secret), `CIRC003` (architecture violation).
  - All file URIs are relative to project root with `uriBaseId=%SRCROOT%` for GitHub Code Scanning compatibility.
  - Severity mapping: `critical`/`high` → SARIF `error`, `medium` → `warning`, `low` → `note`.
  - GitHub Actions integration: upload with `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`.
- `secrets:` Added **git history secret scanning** (`internal/engine/secrets/git_scanner.go`).
  - CLI flag: `--scan-history N` (overrides `secrets.scan_history` config field; 0 = disabled).
  - Scans the last N commits via `git log -p`, limited to added hunk lines only; requires `git` in PATH.
  - Depth capped at `1000` commits; gracefully skipped when `git` is unavailable.
  - Findings attributed with synthetic paths `git:history:<short-commit>:<file>`.
- `parser:` Added **generated code detection and exclusion** (`internal/engine/parser/generated.go`).
  - `IsGeneratedFile(content)` checks first 8 KB for well-known markers: `DO NOT EDIT`, `@generated`, `Code generated by`, `/* Generated by`, `// Generated by`, `AUTO-GENERATED`, `This file is automatically generated`.
  - Supports inline `// circular:ignore` anywhere in the first 8 KB of a file.
  - `ProcessFile` now skips files detected as generated, preventing noise from protobuf/mockgen/stringer output.
- `config:` Added `secrets.scan_history` (`int`, default `0`) TOML field to enable git history scanning from config.
- `config:` Added `output.sarif` (`string`) TOML field to write SARIF report from config.

### Changed
- `parser:` **Retired specific Go and Python extractors** (`GoExtractor`, `PythonExtractor`). Both languages now use the `UniversalExtractor` natively. This consolidates parsing logic, ensures metadata parity (usage tags, confidence scores, ancestry paths) for Go and Python out of the box, and reduces parser-specific maintenance.

### Docs
- Updated `docs/documentation/output.md` with full SARIF output reference including schema, rule table, path handling, and GitHub Actions example.
- Updated `docs/documentation/configuration.md` with `secrets.scan_history` and `output.sarif` field semantics and config schema example.
- Updated `README.md` with Production Readiness Enhancements plan status, new Features entries, CLI flags, and Outputs section.



### Changed
- `history:` Tuned SQLite DSN (`wal_autocheckpoint(1000)`, `synchronous(NORMAL)`, increased busy timeout) and pool settings (idle conns) for high-churn watch mode workloads.
- `graph:` Fixed a race condition in `BatchWriter.Flush` by explicitly draining pending queue instances.
- `app:` Split `internal/core/app/app.go` into focused helper and orchestration files, and moved reusable helper logic into `internal/core/app/helpers`.
- `resolver:` Replaced binary bridge short-circuiting with scored bridge assessment and confidence tiers so medium-confidence matches are classified as probable bridge references instead of being silently resolved.
- `output:` Markdown and TSV generation now surface probable bridge findings (`confidence`, `score`, `reasons`) alongside unresolved/unused findings for auditability.

### Added
- `graph:` Added `ImportanceScore` metric to `ModuleMetrics` using a weighted heuristic (`FanIn/FanOut/Complexity/IsAPI`) to rank module significance.
- `output:` Added `GenerateC4` to Mermaid generator for clustered, edge-aggregated architecture views with red violation highlighting.
- `output:` Added `GenerateInteractiveReport` HTML generator producing a self-contained D3.js interactive treemap for complexity/size visualization.
- `output:` Added `TraceCallSequence` Mermaid generator to produce sequence diagrams from cross-module symbol reference traces.
- `output:` Updated PlantUML generation to use bright red (`#CC0000`) for cycle and violation edges.


### Docs
- Updated `docs/documentation/architecture.md` and `docs/documentation/packages.md` to document the new `internal/core/app/helpers` package and helper delegation.
- Updated `docs/documentation/configuration.md` to note the loader/validator split for config decoding.
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/documentation/configuration.md`, and `docs/documentation/output.md` to document bridge scoring config and probable bridge report/TSV outputs.

- `secrets:` Added optional incremental scan contracts (`LineRange`, `IncrementalSecretScanner`) in `internal/core/ports/ports.go` and adapter support for line-range secret detection.

### Changed
- `resolver:` Added `NewResolverWithSQLite(...)` and `Resolver.Close()` so unresolved/unused analysis can query persisted SQLite symbol rows with automatic in-memory fallback.
- `app:` `AnalyzeHallucinations*` and `AnalyzeUnusedImports*` now build resolvers through DB-aware wiring and prefer SQLite symbol lookup when `[db].enabled=true`.
- `history:` Bumped schema version to `3` and added a `symbols` table migration in `internal/data/history/schema.go` so history and symbol indexes share one SQLite DB.
- `parity:` Normalized cycle-order comparison in `internal/mcp/adapters/adapter_test.go` to remove nondeterministic order flakes in parity assertions.
- `app:` Added `NewWithDependencies(...)` constructor to allow dependency injection of parser/secret collaborators while preserving backward-compatible `New(...)` wiring.
- `app:` Scan/process/watch language filtering now depends on injected `CodeParser` port semantics rather than a hard-wired parser concrete type.
- `app:` `New(...)` now wires the default secret scanner through the `SecretScanner` adapter path instead of constructing a concrete detector directly in app internals.
- `app:` Query-service construction now accepts the `HistoryStore` port contract (`BuildQueryService`) instead of an ad-hoc local history interface.
- `app:` `ProcessFile` now runs optional secret scanning and stores per-file findings in graph state when `[secrets].enabled=true`.
- `app:` Update payloads now include `SecretCount`, and terminal summaries now report aggregate secret findings.
- `mcp:` Made `graph.sync_diagrams` the canonical diagram sync operation and kept `system.sync_outputs` as a backward-compatible alias.
- `runtime:` MCP startup bootstrap now auto-generates missing project bootstrap artifacts (`circular.toml` and `circular-mcp`) when `mcp.auto_sync_config=true`.
- `app:` Diagram generation mode selection now reads `output.diagrams`; default remains module dependency diagrams, while `architecture=true` switches Mermaid/PlantUML to layer-level architecture diagrams.
- `app:` `output.diagrams.component=true` and `output.diagrams.flow=true` are now fully wired to dedicated Mermaid/PlantUML generators.
- `app:` Multiple enabled diagram modes now generate all selected views in one run; when more than one mode is enabled, outputs are written as `-dependency/-architecture/-component/-flow` suffixed files.
- `config:` Default output behavior now enables Mermaid by default and keeps PlantUML disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- `output:` TSV generation now appends a `secret` findings block with masked values (`Value` never includes raw secret text).
- `summary:` Terminal summaries now print a bounded list of masked secret findings (kind/severity/location/value-mask) when detections exist.
- `mcp:` `graph.sync_diagrams` format filtering now accepts `markdown` and includes generated markdown report paths in written targets.
- `resolver:` Cross-language bridge references tagged by parser contexts are now treated as expected links during unresolved-reference analysis.
- `graph:` File clone logic now deep-copies definition decorator metadata to avoid slice aliasing across graph snapshots.
- `parser:` Extended JS/TS/Java/Rust profile extractors to populate definition metadata parity fields (`Visibility`, `Scope`, `Signature`, `TypeHint`) and bridge-call contexts.
- `resolver:` Added framework-aware service contract linking heuristics (for example client/server/servicer symbol-family matching) backed by universal symbol indexing.
- `output:` Diagram output path routing now treats both `/` and `\` as relative-path separators so cross-platform config values resolve consistently between app and MCP adapters.
- `mcp:` `internal/mcp/adapters` scan/query operations now route through `ports.AnalysisService` instead of directly orchestrating scan/query behavior against `App`.
- `cli:` Query-mode runtime flow now resolves the query service through `App.AnalysisService()`; initial scan startup now uses `AnalysisService.RunScan(...)`.
- `app:` Moved history snapshot/trend orchestration into `AnalysisService.CaptureHistoryTrend(...)` so adapters can trigger project-scoped history capture through the service layer.
- `cli:` History mode now calls `AnalysisService.CaptureHistoryTrend(...)` instead of orchestrating snapshot/trend persistence directly in runtime code.
- `mcp:` `scan.run` now captures a history snapshot through the shared analysis-service history use case when DB/history is available.
- `cli:` Watch startup and TUI update flow now use `AnalysisService.WatchService()` + `QueryService(...)` instead of direct `App` watch/update orchestration.
- `mcp:` `system.watch` now starts background watch mode through the watch driving port rather than direct `App.StartWatcher()` calls.
- `app:` Moved output synchronization and markdown report orchestration into `AnalysisService` (`SyncOutputs`, `GenerateMarkdownReport`) so adapters can consume those use cases through driving ports.
- `mcp:` `graph.sync_diagrams` and `report.generate_markdown` now dispatch through `AnalysisService` methods instead of direct output/report orchestration against `App`.
- `app:` Extended `AnalysisService` with trace/impact/cycle/file-list methods (`TraceImportChain`, `AnalyzeImpact`, `DetectCycles`, `ListFiles`) to continue facade thinning in the hexagonal migration.
- `cli:` `--trace` and `--impact` runtime execution now dispatches through `AnalysisService` instead of direct `App` calls.
- `mcp:` `secrets.list`, `secrets.scan` findings, and `graph.cycles` now consume `AnalysisService` methods for graph reads instead of direct adapter access to `App.Graph`.
- `cli:` Runtime summary and output orchestration now route through `AnalysisService` (`SummarySnapshot`, `SyncOutputs`) instead of direct `App.Graph` analysis reads.
- `mcp:` MCP startup `mcp.auto_manage_outputs` flow now routes output sync through `AnalysisService.SyncOutputs(...)`.
- `mcp:` Runtime dependency wiring now requires `ports.AnalysisService` (plus optional `ports.WatchService`) instead of concrete `*app.App`.
- `mcp:` Adapter construction now accepts `ports.AnalysisService` directly, removing concrete app coupling from MCP bootstrap/runtime flow.
- `cli:` Terminal summary rendering now dispatches through `AnalysisService.PrintSummary(...)` instead of direct `App.PrintSummary(...)` calls.
- `cli:` Runtime startup (standard + MCP modes) now resolves `ports.AnalysisService` through an interface-first factory (`internal/ui/cli/runtime_factory.go`) instead of constructing concrete `*app.App` directly in orchestration flow.
- `app:` Summary rendering and markdown report generation orchestration now run through a focused `presentation_service` collaborator shared by `AnalysisService` and the compatibility `App` facade methods.
- `parity:` Added CLI/MCP contract parity coverage for summary/output flows to ensure `AnalysisService` and MCP adapter results stay equivalent for the same graph state.
- `resolver:` Unresolved-reference analysis now runs an explicit bridge pass before stdlib/import/probabilistic matching when bridge mappings are configured.
- `app:` Resolver construction now auto-loads `.circular-bridge.toml` from configured watch roots and applies mappings to both in-memory and SQLite-backed resolver flows.
- `app:` `ProcessFile` now preserves per-file content snapshots and uses changed-line incremental secret scans in watch mode, with full-scan fallback when edits shift line counts.
- `graph:` SQLite symbol persistence now updates incrementally per file (`UpsertFile`, `DeleteFile`, `PruneToPaths`) instead of graph-wide replacement writes during normal app flows.
- `resolver:` App resolver wiring now reuses the persisted SQLite symbol store directly when available, avoiding per-resolver full symbol sync.
- `secrets:` Entropy checks are now limited to a high-risk extension set (`.env`, `.json`, `.key`, `.pem`, `.p12`, `.pfx`, `.crt`, `.cer`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.properties`).

### Fixed
- Improved Go unused import detection accuracy:
  - Fixed false positives for side-effect imports (`_ "pkg"`) and dot imports (`. "pkg"`) by correctly capturing `blank_identifier` and `dot` node kinds in the Go extractor.
  - Enhanced reference extraction to recursively walk all type-bearing nodes (struct fields, interface methods, function signatures, variable types) in the Go extractor.
  - Fixed missing references in top-level variable and constant declarations by ensuring type and value nodes are traversed during extraction.
  - Refined `LocalSymbols` logic to prevent package names and types from being incorrectly treated as local variables.
  - Improved `hasSymbolUse` heuristic in the resolver to explicitly handle Go type decorators like pointers, slices, and maps.
- `pathing:` Normalized shared prefix/path comparisons to avoid mixed-separator false negatives (for example Windows-style `\` vs slash-normalized patterns).

### Changed
- `architecture:` Reorganized internal packages into pillar paths: `internal/core/{app,config,watcher}`, `internal/engine/{parser,resolver,graph}`, `internal/data/{history,query}`, and `internal/ui/{cli,report}`.
- `ui:` Renamed UI package identifiers to match directory names (`package cli`, `package report`) while preserving existing CLI behavior and outputs.
- `parser:` Split parser internals into sub-packages `internal/engine/parser/{registry,grammar,extractors}` while preserving `internal/engine/parser` APIs via bridges.
- `resolver:` Split language-specific resolver logic into `internal/engine/resolver/drivers` while preserving `resolver.New*Resolver()` API surface.
- `report:` Split report format generators into `internal/ui/report/formats` while preserving `report.New*Generator()` API surface.
- `runtime:` Lowered module minimum Go version in `go.mod` from `1.25.x` to `1.24`.
- `docs:` Clarified semantic versioning policy in `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
- `config:` Extended `circular.toml` schema with `[architecture]`, `[[architecture.layers]]`, and `[[architecture.rules]]`.
- `summary:` Terminal summary now includes architecture violations and top complexity hotspots.
- `cmd:` Reduced `cmd/circular/main.go` to a thin entrypoint shell delegating execution to `internal/cliapp.Run(...)`.
- `logging:` UI-mode logging now writes to state-path files with symlink refusal and tighter file permissions.
- `output:` Refined Mermaid and PlantUML visual styling with explicit cycle/violation labels, edge styling, node classes, and deterministic Mermaid link-style ordering.
- `output:` Relative output paths now resolve from auto-detected project root (`go.mod`/`.git`/`circular.toml`), and filename-only Mermaid/PlantUML paths resolve under `docs/diagrams/` by default.
- `output:` Improved Mermaid/PlantUML readability with increased spacing defaults and expanded legends explaining node metric fields (`d`, `in`, `out`, `cx`) and edge labels.
- `app:` Initial scan root handling now normalizes/deduplicates relative and absolute watch roots to prevent duplicate file ingestion and inflated metrics.
- `runtime:` Single-scan and watch startup flow now optionally records one history snapshot and prints a trend summary when `--history` is enabled.
- `runtime:` UI update pipeline now uses query-service-backed module summaries for explorer rendering.
- `history:` Snapshot/trend models now include fan-in/fan-out aggregate metrics and drift deltas for richer trend reporting.
- `runtime:` History persistence backend changed from JSONL to SQLite while preserving opt-in behavior behind `--history`.
- `cli:` Changed default config path to `./data/config/circular.toml` with explicit fallback chain to legacy root paths.
- `runtime:` Reworked config loading to keep explicit `--config` strict while default discovery uses ordered fallbacks and warns on deprecated `./circular.toml`.
- `runtime:` History DB open path now uses config/path resolver (`db.path` under `paths.database_dir`) instead of hard-coded `.circular/history.db`.
- `runtime:` Query/history flows now scope snapshots to the resolved active project key.
- `output:` Output root resolution in `internal/app` now uses the centralized config path resolver.
- `config:` Updated root `circular.example.toml` as a transitional compatibility template pointing to `data/config`.
- `app:` Startup now builds a parser language registry from config, enforces grammar verification by default, and passes registry-aware filters into scan/watch paths.
- `parser:` File language detection now uses registry-driven extension/filename routing instead of hardcoded `.go`/`.py` switches.
- `watcher:` Event filtering now supports registry-driven extension/filename filters plus configurable test-file suffix sets.
- `resolver:` Unused-import analysis now runs only for supported languages and skips unsupported/metadata languages to reduce false positives.
- `resolver:` Stdlib matching is now scoped per file language instead of a merged cross-language namespace.
- `parser:` Grammar loader now initializes runtime grammars for registry-enabled `css`, `html`, `java`, `javascript`, `rust`, `tsx`, and `typescript`.
- `parser:` `gomod` and `gosum` parsing now uses raw-text extraction paths that do not require runtime tree-sitter bindings.
- `app:` App startup now registers default extractors from the language registry instead of hardcoding Go/Python extractor wiring.
- `config:` Expanded example exclude guidance to cover project-specific symbol/import suppression.
- `runtime:` MCP mode now starts from TOML config and enforces CLI incompatibility checks when enabled.
- `docs:` Updated configuration/CLI/README docs and MCP examples to align with the expanded MCP config contract.
- `docs:` Updated MCP allowlist examples to use operation IDs (`scan.run`, `graph.cycles`, `system.sync_outputs`) with legacy alias mapping.

### Fixed
- `compatibility:` Restored `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.24 go test ./...` compatibility by aligning the module Go directive.
- `watcher:` Serialized debounced callbacks to avoid overlapping update handlers during bursty filesystem activity.
- `history:` Improved corrupt-database handling with explicit SQLite initialization/ping failures and drift-safe schema validation.
- `resolver:` Corrected unused-import suppression to honor `exclude.imports` (module path/base name matching) instead of symbol exclusions.
- `config:` Corrected TOML key placement for runtime/example configs so top-level `grammars_path` and `watch_paths` load under the intended schema.
- `resolver:` Treated indexed local symbols (for example `items[i].Field`) as local to avoid false unresolved findings.
- `resolver:` Reported qualified unresolved references even when no matching import is present.

### Removed
- `parser:` Removed language-specific extractor files `internal/parser/{javascript,typescript,tsx,java,rust,html,css,gomod,gosum}.go` after profile parity migration.
